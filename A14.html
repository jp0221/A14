<p>A HTTP cookie is a small amount of text that helps websites track user information across multiple pages of a website and it uses the information to personalize user’s experience on the website. Cookies can be used by websites to see all sorts of information such as what a user is looking for or how much a user spends time on a certain website. When a user logs in on a website, the cookies keep the user logged in across all the pages on the website but once the user logs out the cookie is cleared. It is ethical to use cookies because it is convenient for users to stay logged in and have personalized experience across all pages of a website rather than logging on every page and searching for something every time. After the user logs out the cookie is cleared so it is safe for user since it doesn’t store that information even after the user has logged out.</p>
